Getting started!
The plan:
Incrementally develop and seed a HapiJS API using a mongodb backend.

Open questions:
- How to host a functional app? Heroku? Amazon? Google?
- Seeding data?
- Data sources.
- Do I even need a db?

Getting started is tough!  Not sure where to begin.
I'll start by just creating a file of driver.  Just 2017 driver to get started.

Possible resources:
- Node.js App with mongodb on Heroku:
