Biography


Born in Montreal, Canada in 1998, Stroll was bitten by the racing bug aged five when his father, eminent businessman and occasional amateur sportscar driver Lawrence Stroll, bought him a go-kart.

He won his first race and championship three years later, before being selected for Ferrari‘s prestigious Driver Academy in 2010 following more karting success.

Stroll stepped up to single-seaters in 2014, competing in the Florida Winter Series before winning the Italian Formula 4 championship at his first attempt. Another title, in New Zealand’s Toyota Racing Series, followed in early 2015 before a learning year in European F3 in which he finished fifth with one win, but also had a couple of heavy crashes.

There would be no such problems in the same series in 2016 as, newly hired by Williams as a development driver, he triumphantly claimed the title, picking up 14 victories, 20 podiums and 14 pole positions along the way.

A month later, Williams confirmed him as half of their race line-up for 2017. Driving alongside the highly experienced Felipe Massa, it was a steep learning curve for the F1 newcomer, but Stroll acquitted himself well. Not only did score the team‘s only podium of the season with third place in Azerbaijan, in Italy he became the youngest man ever to start from the front row of the grid.

The 2018 season brings with it a whole new challenge for Stroll - leading Williams‘ campaign as Massa is replaced by another rookie in the form of Sergey Sirotkin.
